### Day 1

- DS - What is regularization? The differences between Lasso and Ridge?
> Regularization: a process of adding a tuning parameter to a model to induce smoothness of the weights (prevent the coefficients to fit so perfectly) in order to prevent overfitting. It is most often done by adding a constant multiple to an existing weight vector, the constant can be any norm (sometimes it will be Lasso or Ridge). Then the model predictions minimize the regularized loss function.
>
> L2 (Ridge): the sum of the square of the weights, it has analytical solution, higher computational efficiency.
>
> L1 (Lasso): the sum of the absolute value of the weights, it performs feature selection better than in sparse cases.

- BA - What is Marketing Mix Model (MMM)?
> In simple terms, MMM is a tool that uses sales and marketing data to establish the return on investment (ROI) of each channel in the marketing mix helping organizations develop the most effective spending level for each channel. In other words, these models not only demonstrate the contribution of each communication program but are sophisticated enough to build future projections enabling budget optimization.

### Day 2

- DS - Can you derive the ordinary least square regression formula?
> Ordinary least square (OLS) or linear least square is a method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model by minimizing the square residuals.
>
> Reference:
> - If use a bivariate problem as an example to derive

- BA - What is Return of Investment (ROI)? How to calculate ROI?
> Return of Investment (ROI) is the benefit to an investor resulting from an investment of some resource. A high ROI means the investment's gain compare favorably to its cost. As a performance measure, ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiency of several different investments.
>
> Return on Investment = Net Income / Investment
> Where:
> Net Income = gross profit - expenses
> Investment = stock + market outstanding + claims

### Day 3

- DS - How to deal with overfitting?
> - Use simpler models
> - Parameter tweak overfitting
>   - Choose the parameters properly when using a learning algorithm.
> - Cross Validation
>   - A standard way to find out-of-sample prediction error. This is better representative of the error you would expect when you're trying to predict a future value, rather than just how well you can fit the data at hand.
> - Regularization
>   - Some sort of regularization can help penalize certain sources of overfitting. A common one you can use in linear models is Ridge or Lasso, where you penalize your model if the sum of the norms of the slopes get too high.

- BA - What is 3C (Product Mix)?
> 3C (Product Mix) is a concept developed by Kenichi Ohmae, a former partner of McKinsey & Company consulting firm. 3C view the problem from the view point of the company, customer, and competitor. This framework is useful to build a strong foundation on our problem. At least we know what’s the general condition of the company, how the customer react lately, and what’s our position regarding our competitor.
